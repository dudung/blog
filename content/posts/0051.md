Today morning there is a online meeting using [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/ybp-haoh-eyx) with [Fajar Darozat](https://www.instagram.com/fajar_darozat/) from [eFishery](https://efishery.com/en/about_us/). One of the four planned products is feeding sensor, which hopefully can be used for following purposes.

Purpose | Status | Diffulty | Target | Pub order | Month
:- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Feeding duration        | p  | s | r    | 4    | Jan-Mar, Apr
Rain detection          | h  | s | m, v | 1, 5 | Apr-Sep, Apr-Sep
Feeding anomaly         | h  | m | m, r | 2, 4 | Jan-Mar, Apr
Average growth          | h+ | c | v    | 6    | Apr-Sep, Apr-Sep
Harvest estimation date | h  | c | v    | 6    | Apr-Sep, Apr-Sep
Fish count estimation   | h  | c | m, v | 3, 7 | Jul-Nov, Dec

+ Status: proven, hypothetical, hypothetical with supporting evidence.
+ Diffulty: simple, moderate, complex.
+ Target: mathematical model, report, validation

There are still some mismatches between time line, scientific ouput (publication order), and features from the feeding sensor. He is informed but the response is not yet received. The problem of each feature must be further analyzed to assure the required time duration as parts of whole time line of the activity in that year. It would be hepful if a flow diagram can also be constructed to connect time order of all desired features.
