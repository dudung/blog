1. Install Kotlin + IDE from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows for Microsoft Windows 10 Home version 10.0.19044 by choosing Community Edition with `.exe` option.
2. Move `ideaIC-2022.3.exe` file from `Downloads` to `Installer/Kotlin`.
3. Click `ideaIC-2022.3.exe` and start the installation, published by JetBrains s.r.o., with size about 541 MB.
3. Follow default path `C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2022.3`, not check all options as suggested, and also keep JetBrains for Start Menu Folder.
4. Close the Setup Window.
5. **The IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2022.3** now can be accessed through Start Menu.

In the afternoon found information the difference beteween [Kotlin and Flutter](https://www.javatpoint.com/flutter-vs-kotlin) and it seems easier to use the last one, at least more [clear in the installation and requirements](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows) and also while [build an application](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab). I believe to uninstall Kotlin and move to Flutter. For a fresh beginner as me I will start with the lowest knowledge barrier first.
