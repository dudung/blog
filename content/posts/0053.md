+ Try to use [Synergy](https://github.com/symless/synergy-core), [barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier), and [Input Leap](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap).
+ Find that for openSUSE Leap barrier only available since [15.2](https://repology.org/project/barrier/versions).
+ Upgdrade openSUSE Leap from existing 15.0 to 15.1 as in [here](https://linuxkamarada.com/en/2019/05/27/how-to-upgrade-from-opensuse-leap-150-to-151/)
+ Later from 15.1 to 15.2 as in [here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-upgrade-opensuse-15-1-to-15-2-using-the-cli/)
+ Yesterday contacted by a colleague from [AIDI](https://aidi.id/) about something and today informed by Dean that it is sufficient addressed to faculty not need to institution.
