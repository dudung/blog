Today, after guided by [Galih Restu Fardian Suwandi](https://lppm.itb.ac.id/id/galih-restu-fardian-suwandi/) in P2MI for 2023 I put the title *Concurrency and Parallelism with Go for Simulation of Physical System*, then I asked [Achmad Imam Kistijantoro](https://www.itb.ac.id/staf/profil/achmad-imam-kistijantoro) about concurrency and parallelism, whose terms are still too technical for me.

In the night slide and some articles have been found, but not yet read thoroughly, and they are
