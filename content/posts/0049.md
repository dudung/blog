Until now there are three work packages as follow
+ **Model Development** Developing a mathematical and numerical model for fully saturated and unsaturated poroelasticity that incorporates [Indonesian tropical peatland](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/006449) characteristics, including the weight of the trees, and the presence of plants roots;
+ **Data Collection, Validation, and Model Callibration** Collection of physicsl properties of Indonesian peatland, including bulk density, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and bulk modulus, in collaboration with our patners; The data collected will provide calibration and validation to our models. Model validation will be conducted using [Inverse Autocovariance Matrix (IAcM)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1028/1/012223), residual checking, and field observation;
+ **Statistical Analysis** In this research project, we will develop a stochastic space-time model [GSTAR](http://staff.uny.ac.id/sites/default/files/132048772/GSTAR%20modeling,%20Dhoriva_ICMSA2010_pdf.pdf) to estimate the value of peat physical properties that vary in space and time based on the peat samples from field measurements;

which is dicussed in [a Zoom meeting](https://itb-ac-id.zoom.us/j/2778453410), that are attended by [Bagus Muljadi](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/expertiseguide/engineering/dr-bagus-muljadi.aspx), [Udjianna Sekteria Pasaribu](https://lppm.itb.ac.id/id/udjianna-sekteria-pasaribu/), [Sapto Wahyu Indratno](https://lppm.itb.ac.id/id/sapto-wahyu-indratno/), [Utriweni Mukhaiyar](https://lppm.itb.ac.id/id/utriweni-mukhaiyar/), [Adilan W. Mahdiyasa](https://lppm.itb.ac.id/id/adilan-widyawan-mahdiyasa/), and [Susi Setiyowati](https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=1_PaGUcAAAAJ).
