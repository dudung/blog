Until now there are three work packages as follow
+ **Model Development** Developing a mathematical and numerical model for fully saturated and unsaturated poroelasticity that incorporates Indonesian tropical peatland characteristics, including the weight of the trees, and the presence of plants roots;
+ **Data Collection, Validation, and Model Callibration** Collection of physicsl properties of Indonesian peatland, including bulk density, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and bulk modulus, in collaboration with our patners; The data collected will provide calibration and validation to our models. Model validation will be conducted using Inverse Autocovariance Matrix (IAcM), residual checking, and field observation;
+ **Statistical Analysis** In this research project, we will develop a stochastic space-time model GSTAR to estimate the value of peat physical properties that vary in space and time based on the peat samples from field measurements;

which are attended by Bagus Muljadi, Udjianna Sekteria Pasaribu, Sapto Wahyu Indratno, Utriweni Mukhaiyar, Adilan Mahdiyasa, and Susi Setiyowati.
