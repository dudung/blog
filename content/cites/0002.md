Angular frequency of a physical pendulum is

$$\tag{1}
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{mgl}{I}},
$$

where $m$ is mass of the pendulum, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is distance from center of mass to pivot point, and $I$ is moment of inertia with respect to the pivot point

$$
I = I_0 + ml^2,
$$

$I_0$ is moment of inertia at the center of mass.
