Angular frequency of a physical pendulum is

$$\tag{1}
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{mgl}{I}},
$$

where $m$ is mass of the pendulum, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is distance from [center of mass](/0003) to pivot point, and $I$ is moment of inertia with respect to the pivot point

$$\tag{2}
I = I_0 + ml^2,
$$

where $I_0$ is moment of inertia at the center of mass of the pendulum. 

If a physical pendulum consists of $N$ objects, where distance between center of mass of object $i$ and center of mass of pendulum is $h_i$ then

$$\tag{3}
I_0 = \sum_{i = 1}^N I_{0i} + m_i h_i^2,
$$

where $I_{0i}$ is moment of inertia of object $i$ at its center of mass and $m_i$ is mass of object $i$, that contributes to $m$

$$\tag{4}
m = \sum_{i = 1}^N m_i,
$$

mass of the pendulum.
