The simple linear regression model has the form of

$$\tag{1}
y = c_0 + c_1 x,
$$

where formula for $c_1$ is

$$\tag{2}
c_1 = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\displaystyle \sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

and for $c_0$ is

$$\tag{3}
c_0 = \bar{y} - c_1 \bar{x}.
$$

The terms $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are calculated using

$$\tag{4}
\bar{x} = \frac1N \sum_i x_i
$$

and

$$\tag{5}
\bar{y} = \frac1N \sum_i y_i,
$$

where $N$  is Number of pairs of $(x_i, y_i)$ data.
