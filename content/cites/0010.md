Angular position $\theta$ of simple pendulum, with bob mass $m$ and arm length $L$, relates to projection along horizontal direction

$$\tag{1}
x = x_0 + L \sin\theta
$$

and vertical direction

$$\tag{2}
y = y_0 - L \cos\theta,
$$

with positive direction of $\theta$ is in counter clockwise direction.
