Angular position $\theta$ corresponds to linear position $s$

$$\tag{1}
s = r \theta,
$$

where $s$ is measured from point $s_0$, whose its angular position is $\theta_0$, along the arc of a circular path with radius $r$. Previous equation can also written in following form

$$\tag{2}
\Delta s = r \Delta \theta,
$$

with $\Delta s = s - s_0$ and $\Delta \theta = \theta - \theta_0$.
