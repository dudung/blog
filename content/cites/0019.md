Since specific heat of a gas depends very much on how a process of changing its temperature is performed, there are specific heat of gases kept at constant temperature ($c_P$) and at constant volume ($c_V$), where some values are given as follow.

Gas | $c_P$ (kcal/kg $\cdot$ C$^\circ$) | $c_V$ (kcal/kg $\cdot$ C$^\circ$)
:- | :-: | :-:
Steam ($100 ^\circ \rm C$) | 0.482 | 0.350
Oxygen                     | 0.218 | 0.155
Helium                     | 1.15  | 0.75
Carbon dioxide             | 0.199 | 0.153
Nitrogen                   | 0.248 | 0.177

Notice that $c_P$ is always greater than $c_V$ for gases. This distinction is usually negigible for liquids and solids.
