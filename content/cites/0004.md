Time derivative of position function $x(t)$ is velocity function $v(t)$,

$$\tag{1}
\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = v(t),
$$

and integral of velocity function $v(t)$ with respect to time $t$ will give position function $x(t)$,

$$\tag{2}
x(t) = \int v(t) dt + C,
$$

with $C$ is constant of integration. If it becomes definite integral

$$\tag{3}
x(t) - x(t_0) = \int_{t_0}^t v(t) dt,
$$

then the integration constant $C$ has the role as initial position $x(t_0)$.
