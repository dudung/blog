A function to select maximum value between two of its arguments can have algebraic form

$$\tag{1}
\max(x, y) = \frac{x + y + |x - y|}{2}
$$

as alternatif to the common form

$$\tag{2}
\max(x, y) = \left\\{
\begin{array}{cc}
x, & x \ge y, \newline
y, & x < y.
\end{array}
\right.
$$

The functions can be extended to function with more arguments, e.g.

$$
\max(a, b, c) = \max(a, \max(b, c))
$$

is for a function with a three arguments.
