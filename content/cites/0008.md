Using the small angle approximation

$$\tag{1}
\sin\theta \approx \theta
$$

equation of motion of a simple pendulum is reduced to

$$\tag{2}
\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L} \theta = 0,
$$

which gives the simple harmonic solution

$$\tag{3}
\theta(t) = \theta_A \sin (\omega t + \varphi_0)
$$

that describes the angular motion of the pendulum, where

$$\tag{4}
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}
$$

is the angular frequency of the oscillation.
